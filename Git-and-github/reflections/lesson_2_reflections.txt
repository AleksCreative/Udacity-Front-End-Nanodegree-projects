What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialise a repository a hidden directory called .git is created and it tells git that I have a new repository to work on. I need to do it to be able to track changes in my files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

its a bridge between the two and a first concept of what files/changes I want to put in one commit.
I think it gives more control over what I want to track and I can review it before i make a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
 I can compare it to the previously commited changes and also teh changes in my working directory to make the right choice.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
