# My FEND Classic Arcade Game

## Game rules

Help the player reach water. Move the player up, down, left and right using the arrows on your keyboard. Avoid the bugs as when you touch one the game is over. Every time the player reaches the water you get 10 points. Try to get the higher score!

## Project specification

The game is one of the Udacity FEND projects. The game criteria were:

#### Error free. The games functions correctly and runs error references

* Player can not move off screen

* Bugs cross the screen

* Bug-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)

* Bug-player collision resets the game

* Something happens when player wins

#### Object Oriented Code

* Game objects (player and bugs) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.

#### Documentation

* A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.

* Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom functions and object methods do.

* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.
