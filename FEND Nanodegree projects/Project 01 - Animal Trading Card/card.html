			<p class="content-description">Eddie was originally a papier-mâché mask used in Iron Maiden's stage backdrop and did not have a body until their first album 'Iron Maiden' was released in 1980. Eddie is occasionally described as "zombie-like" in the press, but he changes his appearance depending on Maiden's individual albums and their corresponding world tours, and has appeared as a cyborg, an Egyptian mummy and a lobotomised mental patient. </p>
